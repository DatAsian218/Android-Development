# Android-Development
This is a respository for my Android Studio apps at my internship.
The app here is an updated version created by huynhtastic (Thanks again Richard!)
Original: https://github.com/huynhtastic/JordanDonutBoiiiLopez

Purpose: This app will take in your donut orders and send them to an email to someone (aka a friend) to go get the donuts.  Currently that is my spam email in the file but feel free to make a branch off this and customize your own app.  Note: When the app emails that person, it might send the email to spam.
